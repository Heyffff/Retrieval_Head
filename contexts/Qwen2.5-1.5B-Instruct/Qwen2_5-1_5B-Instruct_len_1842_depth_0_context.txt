Mr Green is disliked by everyone because he is a mean person and also he can't ride a horse or dive a car.{"features":[{"feature_idx":0,"name":"text","type":{"dtype":"string","_type":"Value"}},{"feature_idx":1,"name":"prompt","type":{"dtype":"string","_type":"Value"}},{"feature_idx":2,"name":"completion","type":{"dtype":"string","_type":"Value"}}],"rows":[{"row_idx":70,"row":{"text":"Chapter: The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\nher mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly\nformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\nafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.\nEven the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\nme, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\nfrom the death-chamber:--\n\n\"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to\nattend on her. It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our\nestablishment!\"\n\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from\nthe disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives\nat hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his\nfather's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been\nbidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon\nourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's\npapers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\nforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\nso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--\n\n\"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But\nthis is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the\ncoroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such\nas this.\"\n\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\nin Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\n\n\"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\nWestenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch\nhere in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself\nsearch for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into\nthe hands of strangers.\"\n\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\nthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to\nhim. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions\nregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the\nletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\nsaying:--\n\n\"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Have you got what you looked for?\" I asked, to which he replied:--\n\n\"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I\nhave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\ndiary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\nnothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\nhis sanction, I shall use some.\"\n\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--\n\n\"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you\nand I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but\nfor the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!\"\n\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\n_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\nand death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the\nwinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and\nturned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall\nwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's\nloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,\ninstead of leaving traces of \"decay's effacing fingers,\" had but\nrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\nthat I was looking at a corpse.\n\nThe Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and\nthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \"Remain till I\nreturn,\" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic\nfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\nplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he\ntook from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and\nplaced it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we\ncame away.\n\nI was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--\n\n\"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\nknives.\"\n\n\"Must we make an autopsy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you\nnow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out\nher heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with\nno tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make\nthe rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that\nyou loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\noperate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for\nArthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow,\nand he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined\nready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall\nunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace\nall, so that none know, save we alone.\"\n\n\"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body\nwithout need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing\nto gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\nknowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.\"\n\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\ntenderness:--\n\n\"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\nbecause it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden\nthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you\nshall know,
