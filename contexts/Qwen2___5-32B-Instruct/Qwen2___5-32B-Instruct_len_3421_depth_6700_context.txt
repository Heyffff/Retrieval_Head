A wide and apparently an impervious\nboundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of\nFrance and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who\nfought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the\nrapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the\nmountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the\npractised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty;\nand it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so\ndark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from\nthe inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their\nvengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant\nmonarchs of Europe.\n\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate\nfrontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness\nof the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies\nbetween the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\n\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the\ncombatants were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the\nChamplain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the\nborders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural\npassage across half the distance that the French were compelled to\nmaster in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination,\nit received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so\nlimpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries\nto perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the\ntitle of lake \"du Saint Sacrement.\" The less zealous English thought\nthey conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains, when they\nbestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of\nHanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded\nscenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of\n\"Horican.\"[1]\n\nWinding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the\n\"holy lake\" extended a dozen leagues still farther to the south. With\nthe high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of\nthe water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the\nadventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual\nobstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the\nlanguage of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.\n\nWhile, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless\nenterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges\nof the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial\nacuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we\nhave just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which\nmost of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested.\nForts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities\nof the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory\nalighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from\nthe dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient\nsettlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the\nsceptres of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these\nforests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were\nhaggard with care, or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were\nunknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its\nshades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes\nof its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of\nmany a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the\nnoontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.\n\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall\nattempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which\nEngland and France last waged for the possession of a country that\nneither was destined to retain.\n\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of\nenergy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great\nBritain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed, by the\ntalents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer\ndreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of\nself-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though\ninnocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her\nblunders, were but the natural participators.\n\nThey had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which,\nreverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army\nled by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors,\nfor his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of\nFrench and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and\nspirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself,\nwith the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of\nChristendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected\ndisaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand\nfanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the\nyells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued\nfrom the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of\ntheir merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of\nwarfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their\nrecollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to\nhave drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of\nmidnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal\nand barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the\nhazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled\nwith terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children\nwhich slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the\nmagnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of\nreason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood,\nthe slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the\nstoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming\ndoubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who\nthought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America\nsubdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their\nrelentless allies.\n\nWhen, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort, which covered\nthe southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the\nlakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army\n\"numerous as the leaves on the trees,\" its truth was admitted with more\nof the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior\nshould feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had\nbeen brought, towards the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian\nrunner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a\nwork on the shore of the \"holy lake,\" for a speedy and powerful\nreinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between\nthese two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which\noriginally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the\npassage of wagons; so that the distance which had been travelled by the\nson of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment\nof troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting\nof a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to\none of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the\nother that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the\nreigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a\nregiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too\nsmall to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was\nleading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay\nGeneral Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern\nprovinces, with a body of more than five thousand men.A new report from the WMO shows that records were once again broken, and in some cases smashed, for greenhouse gas levels, surface temperatures, ocean heat and acidification. By uniting the\nseveral detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed\nnearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising\nFrenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army\nbut little superior in numbers.\n\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and\nmen appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable\nantagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their\nmarch, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du\nQuesne, and striking a blow on their advance.\n\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a\nrumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the\nmargin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the\nfort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to\ndepart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern\nextremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon\nbecame certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the\ncommander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this\nservice, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubt as to the\nintention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps\nand anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from\npoint to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his\nviolent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practised veteran\nmade his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance\nof haste; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently\nbetrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the as yet\nuntried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness. At length the sun set in\na flood of glory, behind the distant western hills, and as darkness drew\nits veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished;\nthe last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer;\nthe trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling\nstream, and a silence soon pervaded the camp, as deep as that which\nreigned in the vast forest by which it was environed.\n\nAccording to the orders of the preceding night, the heavy sleep of the\narmy was broken by the rolling of the warning drums, whose rattling\nechoes were heard issuing, on the damp morning air, out of every vista\nof the woods, just as day began to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall\npines of the vicinity, on the opening brightness of a soft and cloudless\neastern sky. In an instant the whole camp was in motion; the meanest\nsoldier arousing from his lair to witness the departure of his\ncomrades, and to share in the excitement and incidents of the hour. The\nsimple array of the chosen band was soon completed. While the regular\nand trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right\nof the line, the less pretending colonists took their humbler position\non its left, with a docility that long practice had rendered easy. The\nscouts departed; strong guards preceded and followed the lumbering\nvehicles that bore the baggage; and before the gray light of the morning\nwas mellowed by the rays of the sun, the main body of the combatants\nwheeled into column, and left the encampment with a show of high\nmilitary bearing, that served to drown the slumbering apprehensions of\nmany a novice, who was now about to make his first essay in arms. While\nin view of their admiring comrades, the same proud front and ordered\narray was observed, until the notes of their fifes growing fainter in\ndistance, the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass\nwhich had slowly entered its bosom.\n\nThe deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to be\nborne on the breeze to the listeners, and the latest straggler had\nalready disappeared in pursuit; but there still remained the signs of\nanother departure, before a log cabin of unusual size and\naccommodations, in front of which those sentinels paced their rounds,\nwho were known to guard the person of the English general. At this spot\nwere gathered some half dozen horses, caparisoned in a manner which\nshowed that two, at least, were destined to bear the persons of females,\nof a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the wilds of the\ncountry. A third wore the trappings and arms of an officer of the staff;\nwhile the rest, from the plainness of the housings, and the travelling\nmails with which they were encumbered, were evidently fitted for the\nreception of as many menials, who were, seemingly, already awaiting the\npleasure of those they served. At a respectful distance from this\nunusual show were gathered divers groups of curious idlers; some\nadmiring the blood and bone of the high-mettled military charger, and\nothers gazing at the preparations, with dull wonder of vulgar curiosity.\nThere was one man, however, who, by his countenance and actions, formed\na marked exception to those who composed the latter class of spectators,\nbeing neither idle, nor seemingly very ignorant.\n\nThe person of this
